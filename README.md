# *Project Info*
# ***ðŸ’³ Forest Cover Type Prediction***
This is a multiclass classification problem.In this we have to predict the type of Forest Cover type of given input data.An api using streamlit has been created,with the help of the api we can take input data and do the prediction.

For information about dataset and project check the jupyter file and html file present in the notebook folder in the github repository of this project.

# **API:**
https://aangatla-forestcovertypeproject-app-xm4f7p.streamlit.app/


# **Installation guide**

Step1:Install the setup.py file:
pip install .



Step2: Run the streamlit app:
streamlit run app.py




# ***How to do the Predictions using API***

Step1: Go to the following url:
https://aangatla-forestcovertypeproject-app-xm4f7p.streamlit.app/

Step2: Insert the file at the required location

Step3: Wait for the prediction.

For making it easier for testing the model I have provided
some test files in the github repository of this
project.You can download one of those csv files and
can use them for testing the app.
